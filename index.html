		<p>I am an intelligent, ambitious, and versatile individual who is looking for a job that will build upon my programming skills and lead into a career in software 
			development. I have recently graduated from the University of Leeds in Mathematics in which I used <em>Python</em> throughout, especially in my final year project.
			This inspired me to learn more, and since graduating I have also attained some skills in technologies like CSS and HTML, on top of learning how to code using C++.
			This enabled me to develop a game entirely coded within C++, along with creating this online resume from scratch.
			Below is a link to my CV for more details on my credentials.</p>

		<h2>Dissertation (<em>Python</em>)</h2>
		<p>In my final year of studying Mathematics, I researched algorithms to solve Sudokus for my dissertation, before attempting to write my own program in <em>Python</em> to 
			generate and solve new puzzles. The project explores ideas such as backtracking, recursion and the differenent ways of writing a sudoku. Below is my final written up 
			project, with screenshots of code at the end of the document. This project received a first class grade when marked.</p>

	<section id="Game">
		<h2>D&D Game (C++)</h2>
		<p>After graduating I took some online courses in C++, before putting these new learned skills to use in the form of this spoof Dungeons & Dragons board game, in  
			which the player must fight their way through a dungeon and pick up loot on their way to help them defeat tougher enemies down the line. 
			The game is entirely coded in C++ with no other platforms, so there are no sprites or graphics as of yet (the player's position is marked by a 'P' character on a map),
			but this is something I hope to address in upcoming weeks. Although my game may be found lacking in complexity when compared with Assassins Creed, it does show my 
			understanding of important concepts of coding in C++, as well as my ability to pick up new programming languages quickly and independently. Furthermore, I believe 
			that I have been able to put my own sense of humour and personailty into the game by using creative in game messages, which was important for me to emphasise. </p>
